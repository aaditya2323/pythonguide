# Variables in Python 
### What is a variable?
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
example 
```python
a = 10 # a is a variable with value 10
b = 20 # b is a variable with value 20

name = "Kushal" # name is a variable with value Kushal

```
### Assigning Values to Variables

Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example âˆ’

```python
counter = 100          # An integer assignment
miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
name    = "John"       # A string
Married = True         # A boolean
```

# Python input and output 
#### Python Output Using print() function
We use the print() function to output data to the standard output device (screen). We can also output data to a file, but this will be discussed later. An example of its use is given below.

```python
print("Hello World")
```
#### formatted output in python 

```python
name = "Kushal"
age = 20
print("My name is %s and my age is %d"%(name,age))
```
*f string in python* 
```python
name = "Kushal"
age = 20
print(f"My name is {name} and my age is {age}")
```

#### Python Input
Up until now, our programs were static. The value of variables was defined or hard coded into the source code.

To allow flexibility we might want to take the input from the user. In Python, we have the input() function to allow this. The syntax for input() is

```python
input([prompt])
name = input("Enter your name")
print (name)
```
where prompt is the string we wish to display on the screen. It is optional.

# conditional statement 
##### if statement 

if statement is used to check the condition and execute the statement if the condition is true.
the condition runs on boolean value if the condition is true then the statement is executed otherwise not.
```python
if condition:
    statement
```

##### if else statement 
if else statement is used to check the condition and execute the statement if the condition is true otherwise execute the else statement.
```python
if condition:
    statement
else:
    statement
```
##### if elif else statement
if elif else statement is used to check the condition and execute the statement if the condition is true otherwise execute the elif statement if the elif statement is also false then execute the else statement.
```python
if condition:
    statement
elif condition:
    statement
else:
    statement
```
example of if elif else statement
```python
a = 10
b = 20
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
elif a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
else:
    print("a is equal to b")
```

# Looping in python 
looping is used to execute the statement multiple times.
#### for loop
for loop is used to execute the statement multiple times.
syntax of for loop
```python
for i in range(start,stop,step):
    statement
```
example 1
```python
for i in range(10): # here 10 is the stop
    print(i)
```
example 2
```python
for i in range(1,10): # here 1 is the start and 10 is the stop
    print(i)
```
example 3
```python
for i in range(1,10,2): # here 2 is the step size
    print(i)
```

# Python Built in data strycture
buiult in data structure are the data structure which are already defined in python.
#### list

list1[0] = 10
print(list1) # output [10,2,3,4,5]
```
#### list slicing
list slicing is used to get the sublist from the list.
syntax of list slicing

```python
list_name[start:stop:step]
```

example of list slicing
```python
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(list1[0:3]) # output [1,2,3]
print(list1[0:5:2]) # output [1,3,5]
```

#### list methods
list methods are the methods which are used to perform the operation on the list.
##### append()
append() method is used to add the element at the end of the list.
syntax of append() method
```python
list_name.append(value)
```

```
accessing the value of dictionary using the get() method.

### Arrays in python
array is a data structure which is used to store multiple values in a single variable.
in python List is used as an array.

### simple Array program in Python 

```python 
A=[]
for i in range(1,10):
    var= input("Enter value to store in Array :")
    A.append(var)


```

and also print out the topper of the class.
*hint*
```python 
Students = {
    "ram" : {
        "maths" : 80,
        "science" : 90,
        "english" : 70
    },
    "sita":{
        "maths" : 90,
        "science" : 80,
        "english" : 70
    },
    }


for student in Students:
    total = 0
    for subject in Students.get(student):
        total += Students.get(student).get(subject)
    print(f"Total marks of {student} is {total}")
```
8. Create a Dictionary to store the marks of 5 students and print the total marks of the students and average marks of the students and also check if the student is pass or fail. 

conditions for fail 
1. if the student gets less than 40 marks in any subject then the student is fail.
2. if the student gets less than 50% marks in total then the student is fail.
